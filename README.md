# Macomb-ITCS
My intentions for this site are to contribute to open sources and colloborate with others. 
The "modified-shipping-calc" file is a modified version of the week 3 assignment. The destinations include two files named "order.txt" & "jupiter.txt."
The "Github_vowels" file will count the number of vowels in a file as well as the letters X, Y, and Z, and output the results along with the total vowels and other letters.
